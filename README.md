I have a growing passion for web development. I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. While I’m not yet a full-stack developer, I dream of becoming one someday. I’m focused on learning and improving my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies. Thanks for stopping by!
