    <h1>This is me, Amanat Alam, from Bangladesh</h1>
    <p>Currently studying at St. Joseph Higher Secondary School</p>
    <p>I have a growing passion for web development. I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. While I’m not yet a full-stack developer, I dream of becoming one someday. I’m focused on learning and improving my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
